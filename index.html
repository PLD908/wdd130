        <p>My name is Oluyede Divine, and I'm from Lagos, Nigeria. I'm a software developer, currently working for a company in Canada as a frontend developer. I'm currently a student at BYU-Idaho. In my free time, I enjoy playing football and reading. I'm an introvert and prefer staying in rather than going out. I'm easy-going, and my favorite food is pounded yam with vegetable soup.</p>

        <p>Nigeria consists of plateaus and the lowlands between them, which are major river basins fed especially by the Niger River. It has a developing mixed economy based largely on petroleum production and agriculture; manufacturing is growing in importance.</p>
